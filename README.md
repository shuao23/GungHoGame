# Gung Ho Game

## Instructions from Gung Ho
Given the included robot model and animations, please create a game. The gameplay should be 2D side-scrolling perspective (but does not need to scroll necessarily). The code should be in either Github or Bitbucket. Please make commits as you would in a real project.

### Requirements
* Use all 4 animations included.
* Use one shader written by you, which is basically a diffuse shader, but with an outline, and can take a color tint that can be set by the code. Please implement a * custom shader inspector, so that you can see the various components separately.
* Please include a full loop, starting with a title screen, the game, the end, and ability to restart the game.

### Duration
Up to 7 Days, but you can turn it in early

### Unity
Please use Unity 2017. No coding plugins, but you are free to use whatever art assets you would like to include as long as they are not copyrighted.

### Controls
Please make the game playable with a mouse+keyboard, or with an xbox 360 controller attached to the computer.

### Delivery
Simply make the repository public and send us a link. Please keep commits as you go along, so that we can see what the process was for doing the test.
